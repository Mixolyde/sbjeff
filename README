An implementation of my favorite Cheap Ass Game: Starbase Jeff

This is a project of love, and I claim no copyright over the
original game or its bits.

Implemented:
 * A few basic record and macro definitions
 * Create a new, sorted deck of cards
 * Really simple testing harness
 
TODO:
 * Nearly everything
 * Constructors for other records
 * Randomize a deck
 * Text display game state
 * Text display hand
 * Text display player state
 * Design data structure for the actual board during play
 * Single turn
 * Legal card placement test
 * Legal sabotage test
 * Payment route indication
 * Payment route selection
 * Overall game play structure and timeline
 * Game end, clean-up and start next game
 * Non text-based interface
 * Simple AI (random card, random placement)
 * Smart AI
 * AIs with different playstyles
 * Advanced Jeff capsule rules
 * Player database and dbi
 * Unit tests for everything
 * Erlang documentation for entire app
 
Getting Started with the Erlang Shell
cd("git_checkout_dir/ebin").
make:all([load]).
sbjeff_test:unit_test().

Deck = sbjeff_cards:sorted_deck().
